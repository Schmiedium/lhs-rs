Takes in a json file as an argument, parses, and returns a Latin Hypercube Sample
or that's the goal anyway

Currently it parses the json file correctly and that's about it. I have resources for implementing the lhs algorithm, but the project is quite new
Eventually I may try to make this as python pip module, but I can figure out exactly how I want this to work once I get the core functionality up

This is mostly to teach myself Design of Experiment and Rust.
